# Installing ddr-idservice

This page documents the process of installing and configuring `ddr-idservice` on an existing Debian Linux machine.

Most of the commands you will type will be entered as `root`.  To become `root`, type the following at a command prompt:
``` bash
$ su -
[enter root password]
```

As per convention, variables in this documentation are written in upper case with underscores, starting with a "$" sign.


## DDR Applications and Dependencies - Automated Installation

In this section we will use a script to automatically install the DDR code and its supporting applications.

Log in to your VM and become `root`.  Then add a `ddr` user, install the prerequisites, and install the `ddr-idservice` app itself.
``` bash
# adduser ddr
[enter info]
# apt-get install git-core

# git clone git@github.com:densho/ddr-idservice.git /opt/ddr-idservice
# cd /opt/ddr-idservice/idservice

# If you are testing a branch, switch to that branch.
# git checkout -b BRANCHNAME origin/BRANCHNAME

# make install-mariadb
# mysql -p -u root
CREATE DATABASE ddridservice CHARACTER SET utf8;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ddridservice.* TO ddr@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# make get
# make install
```

Wait as Make installs Debian packages and Python code and builds up your system.  On a basic VM this takes between 5-10 minutes.


## Configuration

The default settings in `/etc/ddr/idservice.cfg` are specific to the Densho production system.  Settings in `/etc/ddr/idservice-local.cfg` will override the defaults.

Edit `/etc/ddr/idservice-local.cfg` to include the following text.
``` ini
[public]

# Absolute path to directory that will hold static and user-uploaded files.
# Note: Should match MEDIA_ROOT and STATIC_ROOT in Makefile.
# Note: Should not have trailing slashes.
static_root=/var/www/idservice/static
media_root=/var/www/idservice/media
```

To get the nice Django error messages edit `/opt/ddr-idservice/idservice/settings.py`.  **WARNING: setting `DEBUG = True` in a production environment is a security risk!**:
``` python
DEBUG = True
THUMBNAIL_DEBUG = False
```

`ddr-idservice` uses the Django ORM to store data about locally-created thumbnail images in a SQLite3 database.  Create database tables for installed applications.:
``` bash
# cd /opt/ddr-idservice/idservice
# su ddr
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Restart the servers and the web application to see the effects of your edits.:
``` bash
# make restart
```

At this point `ddr-idservice` is installed but the Elasticsearch database contains no data.
